The ImageGallery component is designed to fetch and display a collection of images from Firestore in a gallery layout. Here's a breakdown of how the component works:
    	useEffect and useState are React hooks used for managing side effects and component state, respectively.
	getDocs and collection are functions from Firestore used to fetch documents from a collection.
	db is the Firestore database instance imported from the firebase.js configuration file.
	images: State variable to store the list of image URLs retrieved from Firestore.
	isLoading: State variable to indicate if data is still being fetched.
	error: State variable to store any error messages encountered during data retrieval.
	useEffect is used to run the fetchImages function when the component mounts.
	fetchImages: An asynchronous function to fetch image URLs from Firestore.
	collection(db, "patient"): Gets a reference to the "patient" collection in Firestore.
	getDocs(imageCollectionRef): Retrieves all documents from the specified collection.
	data.docs.map((doc) => doc.data().imageUrl): Maps through the documents to extract the imageUrl field from each 								document.
	Updates images state with the fetched URLs.
	Sets isLoading to false and handles errors if any occur.
add component  that handles the process of uploading an image to Firebase Storage and then storing the image's URL in a Firestore document:
 	doc, setDoc from 'firebase/firestore':

	doc: Retrieves a reference to a Firestore document.
	setDoc: Writes data to a Firestore document, replacing the document if it already exists, or creating it if it 	does not.	
	uuidv4 from 'uuid':

	Generates a unique identifier (UUID), which is used to ensure that each image has a unique name in Firebase 	Storage.
	storage from './firebase.js':

	Imports the Firebase Storage instance from your Firebase configuration file.
	ref, uploadBytes, getDownloadURL from 'firebase/storage':

	ref: Creates a reference to a location in Firebase Storage.
	uploadBytes: Uploads a file to Firebase Storage.
	getDownloadURL: Retrieves the public download URL for a file in Firebase Storage.
